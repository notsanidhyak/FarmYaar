## Introduction

FarmYaar is a game-changing app that addresses some of the most pressing issues faced by farmers worldwide. The app aims to help farmers grow smarter by leveraging cutting-edge technology to provide crucial insights and support.


## Current Issues

Farmers today face issues with irrigation, a lack of weather information, a lack of knowledge about government programmes, etc. So how can we assist our farmers by making their lives easier, increasing their level of independence, and raising their awareness?


## Real World Scenarios (TOI News)

* 70% of irrigation water is wasted.

* CAG Report: 67% Farmers are unaware of Govt schemes.

* Irrigation system losses: 15%, Water effectivelly used by crop: 45%, Field application losses: 25%, Farm distribution losses: 15%

* Mustard, chickpeas crops majorly affected by unexpected rise in heat.


## Our Solution

* Integrated sensors (with arduino) to tell you real time data (temp, moisture, humidity) of your soil conditions to help you tune your irrigation practices.

* Our app will alert farmers beforehand about any weather hazards such as rain, storms, droughts, cyclones, etc which are significant risks to crop production (Notifications would be sent to the user).

* It will let farmers interact with other farmers in their region, creating a community where they can share knowledge and ideas (This will help them share ideas and tackle problems to their farm related solution).

* Guide farmers about new government schemes and latest news in their local area.

* The app will also provide valuable information about soil types and the crops that can be grown in a specific area using image detection with the help of OpenCV, which is especially helpful for farmers with limited knowledge.

* Finally, Farmyaar will be multilingual and user-friendly, enabling farmers from different regions to use it with ease and convenience. By addressing these challenges, Farmyaar will empower farmers worldwide and revolutionize the agricultural sector.
